# blsa_mims

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `blsa_mims` is to:

1. We wish to determine if alternative measures of physical activity, derived from the raw acceleration signals, track similarly with health outcomes as activity counts.  Namely, we focus on open-source pipelines and implementations to transform raw files into activity summaries.  
2. As activity counts have been used in a number of studies and activity-level thresholds have been derived, we wish to estimate equivalent thresholds in these open-source measures to allow for similar analysis done with activity counts. 
3. We describe the advantages of using these open source tools and present an R package that can aid in this analysis, while also providing the source code to generate our analysis.

## covariates

This directory contains covariates data files. 

The `mastervisit` files (`.sas7bdat`, `.rdata`, `.dta`) are last modified on 2020-08-18 are up to date as of 2020-12-30 (clarified with Jennifer Schrack on 2020-12-30). 

## csv

This directory contains `.csv.gz` files with name suffix `60sec.csv.gz`. These are the raw output from ActiLife giving activity counts -- proprietary minute-level summary statistic of accelerometry data. 

Specifically, these are "vector magnitude of counts", i.e. a square root of the sum of squares of X, Y, and Z axis-specific activity counts (clarified with Jacek Urbanek on 2020-12-10). 

The files in `csv` directory are last modified on 2020-08-14 are up to date as of 2020-12-28 (clarified with Jacek Urbanek on 2020-12-28). 

## gt3x

* `gt3x.gz` suffix files -- TODO JM
* `RAW.csv.gz` suffix files (few) -- TODO JM
* `_MIMS.csv.gz` suffix files (few) -- TODO JM

Also: 

* `gzip.sh` -- TODO JM
* `helper_functions.R` -- TODO JM [MK: are these some older copy of up to date code file of similar name at blsa_mims/code/helper_functions.R ? ]
* `make_mims.R` -- TODO JM [MK: are these some older copy of up to date code file of similar name at blsa_mims/code/make_mims.R ? ]
* `synced.txt` -- TODO JM [MK: looks empty ]

## mats

This directory contains Matlab `.mat` files. These are the raw output from ActiLife giving acceleration measurements [*g*] along three orthogonal axes (subsecond-level accelerometry data). These were received from Jacek Urbanek between 2020-12-27 and 2020-12-29. 

These are "new" MATLAB files, which means they are essentially HDF5 files. Old `.mat` files can be read using `R.matlab::readMat`, these cannot.  Since they are `hdf5` files, we can use `rhdf5` to read them in.  In `code/helper_functions.R` the `read_acc_mat` function can read it in as a data.frame.

## mats_old

Previous (outdated) version of `mats` directory. 

## open_measures

* `_MIMS.csv.gz` suffix files -- TODO JM

## qc 

* `_read.gt3x.txt` suffix files -- TODO JM
* `_AGread.txt` suffix files -- TODO JM

## resampled

* `.rds` files -- TODO JM 

## results

* `comparison_data.rds` -- TODO JM
* `device_info.rds` -- TODO JM
