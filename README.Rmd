# blsa_mims

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `blsa_mims` is to:

1. We wish to determine if alternative measures of physical activity, derived from the raw acceleration signals, track similarly with health outcomes as activity counts.  Namely, we focus on open-source pipelines and implementations to transform raw files into activity summaries.  
2. As activity counts have been used in a number of studies and activity-level thresholds have been derived, we wish to estimate equivalent thresholds in these open-source measures to allow for similar analysis done with activity counts. 
3. We describe the advantages of using these open source tools and present an R package that can aid in this analysis, while also providing the source code to generate our analysis.

# Repo documentation 

## code

* `add_nonwear.R` -- runs WearNonWear function; reads files with suffix `60sec.csv.gz` from `/csv`, runs WearNonWear algorithm, saves as file with suffix `_nonwear.csv.gz`[MK: TODO JM was it actually saved? I do not see any such files in `/csv`]
* `ag_read.R` -- contains code to read gt3x files with `AGread::read_gt3x` 
* `check_dims.R` -- runs `read_xi_dims` function from  `/code/helper_functions` to check for correctness of the dimensions of files from `mats` dir
* `check_gt3x_vs_csv.R` -- runs checks related to open-source reading of acc data files
* `check_gt3x_vs_mat.R` -- cruns hecks related to open-source reading of acc data files
* `compare_nonwear.R` -- TODO JM
* `get_metadata.R` -- runs extraction of meta data (Acceleration Max, Acceleration Min, Serial Number, Device Type) for all files in `/gt3x` and saves summary at `results/device_info.rds`
* `gt3x_read.R` -- contains code to read gt3x files with `AGread::read_gt3x` [TODO JM : how it differs from `ag_read.R` ? ]
* `helper_functions.R` -- contains set of util functions, including: 
    * `round_away_zero` -- TODO JM 
    * `quick_ai` -- TODO JM 
    * `full_measures` -- gets all measures to compare other than MIMS
    * `mad` -- short function for MAD
    * `get_dynamic_range` -- get the dynamic range in g from header (from Jacek header)
    * `read_mat` -- general function to read in matlab .mat
    * `read_acc_mat` -- specific function to read in Jacek accelerometry .mat
    * `sub_thing` -- util for parsing the header from RAW csv from Actilife
    * `WearNonWear` -- from Jacek - implementation of Choi
    * `tabber` -- quick tabulation function of long logicals
    * `cwa_mims` -- get MIMS from a CWA file (for Biobank)
    * `read_xi_dims` -- TODO JM 
* `make_mims.R` -- runs `SummarizedActigraphy::read_acc_csv` function to derive MIMS for all files at `/gt3x`; saves result at `/open_measures/` as `_MIMS.csv.gz` suffix files [TODO JM : am I right it used /gt3x?]
* `make_thresholds.R` -- runs code to estimate mapping between values of metrics with gam models; note comments for any data pre-filtering done
* `mat_make_mims.R` -- TODO JM
* `plot_comparison.R` -- generates data plots
* `resample_data.R` -- TODO JM
* `rsync_gt3x.R` -- script to upload `/gt3x` files from external location 
* `WearNonWear.R` -- wear/non-wear algorithm; likely former version of [arctools/R/get_wear_flag.R](https://github.com/martakarass/arctools/blob/master/R/get_wear_flag.R) 

Also: 

* files with prefix `CSV.e4069838.` -- TODO JM [MK: looks like job logs, to be deleted?]

## covariates

This directory contains covariates data files. 

The `mastervisit` files (`.sas7bdat`, `.rdata`, `.dta`) are last modified on 2020-08-18 are up to date as of 2020-12-30 (clarified with Jennifer Schrack on 2020-12-30). 

## csv

This directory contains `.csv.gz` files with name suffix `60sec.csv.gz`. These are the raw output from ActiLife giving activity counts -- proprietary minute-level summary statistic of accelerometry data. 

Specifically, these are "vector magnitude of counts", i.e. a square root of the sum of squares of X, Y, and Z axis-specific activity counts (clarified with Jacek Urbanek on 2020-12-10). 

The files in `csv` directory are last modified on 2020-08-14 are up to date as of 2020-12-28 (clarified with Jacek Urbanek on 2020-12-28). 

## gt3x

* `gt3x.gz` suffix files -- TODO JM
* `RAW.csv.gz` suffix files (few) -- TODO JM
* `_MIMS.csv.gz` suffix files (few) -- TODO JM

Also: 

* `gzip.sh` -- TODO JM
* `helper_functions.R` -- TODO JM [MK: are these some older copy of up to date code file of similar name at blsa_mims/code/helper_functions.R ? ]
* `make_mims.R` -- TODO JM [MK: are these some older copy of up to date code file of similar name at blsa_mims/code/make_mims.R ? ]
* `synced.txt` -- TODO JM [MK: looks empty ]

## mats

This directory contains Matlab `.mat` files. These are the raw output from ActiLife giving acceleration measurements [*g*] along three orthogonal axes (subsecond-level accelerometry data). These were received from Jacek Urbanek between 2020-12-27 and 2020-12-29. 

These are "new" MATLAB files, which means they are essentially HDF5 files. Old `.mat` files can be read using `R.matlab::readMat`, these cannot.  Since they are `hdf5` files, we can use `rhdf5` to read them in.  In `code/helper_functions.R` the `read_acc_mat` function can read it in as a data.frame.

## mats_old

Previous (outdated) version of `mats` directory. 

## open_measures

* `_MIMS.csv.gz` suffix files -- files with MIMS computed for  all files at `/gt3x`; derived with `code/make_mims.R` file [TODO JM : am I right it used /gt3x?]


## qc 

* `_read.gt3x.txt` suffix files -- TODO JM
* `_AGread.txt` suffix files -- TODO JM

## resampled

* `.rds` files -- TODO JM 

## results

* `comparison_data.rds` -- TODO JM
* `device_info.rds` --  summary of meta data (Acceleration Max, Acceleration Min, Serial Number, Device Type) extracted for all files in `/gt3x`; derived with `/code/get_metadata.R`
