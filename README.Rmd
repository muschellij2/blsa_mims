# BLSA MIMS project

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The project uses raw accelerometry data from ~700 participants in Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), each monitored for aporox. 1 week with a wrist-worn ActiGraph sensor.  

The goal of the project is to:

1. Develop and use R software to aggregate raw data at minute-level with open-source measures: MIMS, ENMO, MAD, AI.

2. Quantify association between AC and open-source measures marginally and conditionally on age, sex and BMI. 

3. Harmonize minute-level AC with open-source measures via one-to-one mapping.  

4. Reproduce some of the published BLSA results that used AC with the use of the open-source measures.
