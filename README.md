# blsa\_mims

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `blsa_mims` is to:

1.  We wish to determine if alternative measures of physical activity,
    derived from the raw acceleration signals, track similarly with
    health outcomes as activity counts. Namely, we focus on open-source
    pipelines and implementations to transform raw files into activity
    summaries.  
2.  As activity counts have been used in a number of studies and
    activity-level thresholds have been derived, we wish to estimate
    equivalent thresholds in these open-source measures to allow for
    similar analysis done with activity counts.
3.  We describe the advantages of using these open source tools and
    present an R package that can aid in this analysis, while also
    providing the source code to generate our analysis.
